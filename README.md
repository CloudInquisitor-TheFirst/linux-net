This is the repository for the *[Linux Networking Basics & Beyond](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/linux-networking/9780138358051/)* video course.



> **Important!**: Make sure that you have at least two Linux systems (or virtual machines) ready to go! For details, see the [Lab Setup](lab-setup/lab-setup.md) document.

> In short, to follow along with me I recommend a Debian server as well as a Linux client (Debian as a client, Fedora Workstation, or Ubuntu Desktop). You can find step-by-step instructions and videos about how to install Debian (and other distros) at my website: https://prowse.tech/linux-installs/. And don't forget to subscribe for the latest updates!
