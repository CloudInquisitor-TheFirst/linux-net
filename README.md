This is the repository for the *Linux Networking Basics & Beyond* video course.

> *Note: Link to course coming soon...*

All of the labs can be found within. The step-by-step lab files are written in Markdown. 

> Note: Make sure that you have at least two Linux systems (or virtual machines) ready to go! For details, see the [Lab Setup](lab-setup/lab-setup.md) document. 

> In short, to follow along with me I recommend a Debian server as well as a Linux client (Debian as a client, Fedora Workstation, or Ubuntu Desktop). You can find step-by-step instructions and videos about how to install Debian (and other distros) at my website: https://prowse.tech/linux-installs/. And don't forget to subscribe for the latest updates!
