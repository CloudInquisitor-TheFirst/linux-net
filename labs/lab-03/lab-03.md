## Analyzing the System with the `ip a` and `ip r` Commands

- Analyze the networking configuration:

	`ip a ; ip r`

	That was a two-part command `ip a` and `ip r`. We joined them together with a semi-colon `;`. These commands will display the TCP/IP information for the network adapters as well as the basic routing information for the system including the default gateway. 
	
	Take a few minutes to analyze the results.

	From this information you should be able to find out your IP address, netmask, and gateway address. 

	> Important: Use these commands to analyze any Linux system you encounter!

	> Note: the spaces around the semi-colon are not necessary. For example: `ip a;ip r`. The less keys you press, the more you save your fingers!

👍 **Fantastic! Another lab complete!**
