# Lab 40 ⚙️

## Speedtest-cli Challenge

For the final lab you will install `speedtest-cli` and analyze your Internet connection speed (or data throughput if you will).

Install it!

`sudo apt install speedtest-cli`

Run it!

`speedtest-cli`

Analyze the results and think about how you can make your Internet connection faster!

To hide any public IP addresses and/or ISP information, use the following option:
