## Viewing the NetworkManager Log

Linux keeps a "journal" or a list of events that have happened on the system. You can query this journal with the journalctl command. 

- Type `journalctl` and use the arrow keys or the pageup and pagedown keys to see some of the logs. There is a lot of information, so we need to filter it. Press 'q' to escape and continue on.

- Filter by the unit or service. Issue the following command:

	`journalctl -u NetworkManager`

	This displays the journal entries related to the NetworkManager service. -u allows us to select the service (or unit) that we need to learn more about. But there can still be a lot of information so we can use the tail option to show the last 10 lines.

- Using tail: Issue the following command to see the last 10 lines of the journal as they pertain to the NetworkManager service.
	
	`journalctl -u NetworkManager | tail -10`

- Modify the command further so that the information is sorted into columns and is outputted to less. 

	`journalctl -u NetworkManager | tail -10 | column -t | less`

	The results might look similar to this:

	```

	```
 
	You could also use the `-xe` and `-xeu` option combinations with `journalctl`.
	
	> Note: For more information on the journalctl command, type `journalctl --help`, and for more in-depth information, see the manual page: `man journalctl`

# Summary of the Three Main Networking Services
The three main networking services that we covered here are: networking, networkd, and NetworkManager. Each has its place and each has pros and cons compared to the others. 

You will normally find the networking service on a Debian server, the networkd service on an Ubuntu server, and the NetworkManager service on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server (or Fedora/CentOS). 

The commands you use for each of the services will vary. The networking service will work well with commands such as `ip a`, `ifup`, `ifdown`, and modifying configuration files with VIM. networkd will work well with commands such as `ip a`, `networkctl`, and in the case of Ubuntu, `netplan`. The NetworkManager service is all about `nmcli` and the myriad of other tools available to you. 

Study the key points of these services and their respective Linux distributions and the configuration files and commands used within each.
